== Hercules DJControl Compact midi controller

I found this controller at a garage sale for 5â‚¬, intending to use it as a midi controller for piHPSDR. 

As one would expect, it has various buttons and potentiometers. But with the use of "mode" and "shift" keys, it expands the number of available controls.

This file contains the midi codes of the buttons and controls and on which piHPSDR function they are mapped.

This is the file to use with piHPSDR.
